The news is getting hard to keep up with, and harder to read.

Today I found myself tearing up while reading the week's news, feeling devastated by Trump's cruelty and frustrated by his complete stupidity and obvious greed. I wondered, not for the first time, whether it might be better not to read the news at all.

But stronger than that momentary flash of doubt, I know that we have a responsibility as Americans to know what our government is doing, at home and abroad (at least as much as is feasible in today's information age). Turning a blind eye to the truth because it's uncomfortable to look at will only make us complicit.

Ignorance may be bliss, but ignorance does not bring change, only stagnation. If we desire change, we must know what damage has been done in order to know what to change. America is, for now, a government by the people. And we MUST be active participants in our government if we wish to keep it that way.

So feel that anger, embarrassment, sadness, and fear. Use those negative emotions as fuel, to drive you to thoughtful action rather than paralysis.

Remember every crime you witness this lawless administration commit.<br/>
Remember every injustice it codifies into law.<br/>
Remember it all when deciding where you will volunteer your time.<br/>
Remember it all on election day.

We are not powerless, but our strength IS in numbers.

Be brave, for now is when we are at our strongest. Our fascist opponents, who would disenfranchise anyone who challenges their authority, are only human. That means that they are not invincible, and that justice can prevail. It also means that we must not fall to their level when the day comes where the tables are turned, lest we become oppressors ourselves. 

The cycle of hatred must be ended. And for that, we must be compassionate, and we must not be ignorant.

Don't look away; I won't.
