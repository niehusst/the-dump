I liked the concept of quests from last year, so I'm doing 'em again! In my opinion, quests more closely align with the concept of life being a journey, than a series of goals does. Plus, I'd rather go on a quest than do a bunch of tasks.

## 2026 Quests

Again, I set forth on this perilous path of life. These quests are centered on consistency, as I seek fun and knowledge amongst the murky abyss of a new year.

## 1. Practice Ultimate throws consistently

I want to improve the consistency of my throws, particularly as I ramp up for tryouts in the Spring. Lots of advice says to throw (or do anything) a little every day for incremental progress. I'll aim for getting a few minutes of tossing in every day, but I'm sure I'll miss a day occasionally. I just need to keep going and do my best.

It would also be cool if I could improve my hammer enough to make it game-ready.

## 2. Take a class

There's so much I want to learn, but last year I didn't make much time for learning things outside of work and Ultimate. This year, I'd like to set aside at least 1 evening each week to work on learning something new. Not as a hard rule, but as a reminder.

## 3. Start a new side project

Last year, I completed my [net-go project](https://playonlinego.xyz) to the cacophonous applause of crickets who were (and still are) unaware of its existence. But I had a lot fun building it and learned a few things along the way. Now that my job-hunt is complete, I'd like to find a new project to work on.

Similar to quest #2, I'd like to have a dedicated day of the week for working on projects (or other activities).

## 4. Seek out parallel play

There are so many solo activities I want to do this year (see previous quests), but I still want to spend more time with my friends and partner as well. I recently remembered the concept of parallel play, and thought it could be worth testing out. I'm hoping it will allow me to spend time with the people I want to, even if I don't have a cooperative activity planned, or if target person isn't in the mood for one.

As a mini-boss in this quest, I want to work toward deciding to do an activity, and then announcing to a group-chat that I will be doing said activity, so that others will have a chance to join me.
